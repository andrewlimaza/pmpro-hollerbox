Integrates Paid Memberships Pro with the Holler Box plugin to display popups/banners by membership level.

== Description ==

Holler Box by Scott Bolinger is an open source plugin available for download in the WordPress repository (https://wordpress.org/plugins/holler-box/). The plugin allows you to create popups or banner notifications that display on the front end of your website. eCommerce site owners are using these popups to collect leads and generate more sales.

This integration adds Membership restrictions when using the Paid Memberships Pro plugin to your boxes, allowing you to display unique content based on the user's membership status, either a specific level or for no level (non-member).
